## A simple application to explain IPv4 addresses and netmasks

This application was written to help with a year 10 schools class to explain how IP addresses and netmasks work.  It provides a simple interactive interface where the students can type in an IP address and netmask and see how these relate by showing the binary representations of these against each other.  This allows students to easily see whether different IP addresses would fall into the same subnet, given the netmask they are using.
